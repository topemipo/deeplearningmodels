# Deep Learning Models
This repository contains three deep learning models - Simple Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network implemented on different use cases.

<h1>Simple Neural Network</h1>

<p>
This model was used for a simple binary classification problem with two features. The features were standardized using <code>StandardScaler</code> before being split and sent into the neural network for training. The figure below visualizes the architecture chosen for the neural network.

<p>
The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. Training was conducted over 200 epochs with a batch size of 50.
